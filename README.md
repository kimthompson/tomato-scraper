# tomato-scraper

> Made with the [scrape-it node.js package](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/scrape-it) by [Ionică Bizău](https://github.com/IonicaBizau).

A simple scraper of actors' filmographies and their films' scores from Rotten Tomatoes. This will eventually run for 500 or so top actors to feed a D3.js visualization I'm making.

To run, simply download or fork this repository, navigate to it in your terminal/command prompt, and type `npm install` to install all the necessary packages. Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed globally on your machine as well. Then, you can run the command `node [your filename here]` to run the scraper and see the JSON printout in your terminal.
